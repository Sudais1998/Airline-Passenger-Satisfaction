## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to evaluate airline passenger satisfaction by analyzing survey responses and flight data. The goal is to uncover key factors affecting passenger experience, identify trends, and provide insights that airlines can leverage to improve service quality.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on structured airline passenger data, including:
- **Passenger survey responses:** Customer feedback on flight experience, service quality, and overall satisfaction.
- **Flight performance data:** Operational metrics such as flight delays, cancellations, and seating class distribution.
- **Demographic information:** Passenger age, travel frequency, and ticket type.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, and Dashboard Development
- **Power Query:** Data Transformation
- **Data Visualization:** Charts, Graphs, and Interactive Dashboards

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
During data preparation, the following steps were performed:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Formatting and structuring data for dashboard analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key exploratory questions included:
- What are the primary drivers of passenger satisfaction?
- How do flight delays impact overall customer ratings?
- What is the distribution of satisfaction levels across different passenger demographics?
- How does seating class influence passenger experience?

## Key Findings
- Passengers in **premium and business classes** reported higher satisfaction levels compared to economy class travelers.
- **On-time departures** significantly impact satisfaction scores, with delayed flights leading to lower ratings.
- **Frequent flyers** tend to be more satisfied due to loyalty perks and better customer service experiences.
- Younger passengers tend to give lower satisfaction scores compared to older travelers.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- Improve **on-time performance** to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Enhance **economy class experience** by improving seating comfort and service quality.
- Offer targeted loyalty programs and personalized experiences for **frequent flyers**.
- Leverage passenger feedback to address key pain points in the flight experience.

## Limitations
- Some data fields had missing values, which were either imputed or excluded to maintain analysis integrity.
- The dataset may not fully represent all airline customers globally, as satisfaction factors vary by region.
